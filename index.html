      <p>I was born in Houston, Texas and have lived near I-45 my whole life. My younger days were filled with musical studies and performances that led me to every state in the Country (except Montana and the Dakotas), 
        and much of who I am today is owed to the fine educators and mentors I was lucky to be placed under the tutelage of. Originally, I began learning guitar as a child, but soon after picked up the clarinet for school, where I also taught myself 
        tuba (the key to my touring the country) and switched permanently from guitar to bass, which is primarily what I perform on now-a-days.</p>
     

      <p>Although I spent many hours practicing, computers have always had a large presence in my life as well. At an early age, I read books on HTML and built
        my own basic web pages for fun. This, accompanied with a solid childhood of RTS games, has given me a great amount of comfort behind a keyboard. I plan on utilizing
        my unique set of keyboard skills, as well as the elevated standards, discipline and problem solving skills aquired as a professional performer to greatest aid whichever company I decide to work with.</p>
